# Rich Text Field Renderer

## Summary

A simple rich text field renderer to display the full contents of a rich text HTML field. Normally a rich text field will get truncated in a list or library view if the contents consume too much vertical space. This SPFx field customizer will display the entire contents of the field without vertical truncation. See screenshot below for comparison.

## Setup Instructions
### Pre-requisites
- App Catalog: Ensure the [App Catalog](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/use-app-catalog) is setup in your SharePoint Online tenant
- PnP PowerShell: Ensure you have the latest version of the [SharePointPnPPowerShellOnline](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-pnp/sharepoint-pnp-cmdlets?view=sharepoint-ps) module installed.

### Installation
1. Download the SPFx package [rich-text-field-renderer.sppkg](./sharepoint/solution/rich-text-field-renderer.sppkg) file from Github (or clone the repo and build the package yourself)
2. Upload sppkg file to the 'Apps for SharePoint' library in your Tenant App Catalog
3. Click the 'Make this solution available to all sites in your organization' checkbox and then click Deploy
4. Connect to the target site(s), then configure each list or site field that requires the Custom Rich Text Renderer using steps below.
   #### PnP PowerShell
   ```powershell
   Connect-PnPOnline -Url "https://tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/target"
   
   # Connect the custom field renderer to a target field
   # Run the following command for each field that requires the renderer
   Set-PnPField -List "<<List Title>>" -Identity "<<Field Internal Name>>" -Values @{ ClientSideComponentId = [Guid]::new("2a3318bf-6c55-4c14-acee-b5da9c314cc2") }
   ```

### Updates
Follow the same steps as installation. Overwrite the existing package in the 'Apps for SharePoint' library when uploading the new package. 

> __Tip__: Be sure to check-in the sppkg file after the deployment if it is left checked-out.

   # Disconnect the custom field renderer from a target field
   # Run the following command for each field that should no longer use the renderer 
   Set-PnPField -List "<<List Title>>" -Identity "<<Field Internal Name>>" -Values @{ ClientSideComponentId = $null }
